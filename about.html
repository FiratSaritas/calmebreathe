        <h2>About Calm Breathe</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Calm Breathe, your personal sanctuary for peace and focus. In today's fast-paced world,
            finding moments of calm is more important than ever. Our platform is designed to help you
            achieve just that, offering a simple yet powerful tool for relaxation, concentration, and better sleep.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>
            Our mission is to make mindfulness and stress relief accessible to everyone, everywhere.
            We believe that a few minutes of intentional breathing and soothing sounds can significantly
            improve mental well-being, reduce stress, and enhance daily productivity. We are committed
            to providing a free, user-friendly, and privacy-conscious experience.
        </p>
        <h3>What We Offer</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Guided Breathing Sessions:</strong> Tailored breathing patterns for relaxation, focus, or sleep.</li>
            <li><strong>Immersive Environments:</strong> Choose from a variety of ambient sounds like ocean waves,
                forest whispers, or the gentle crackle of a campfire to create your ideal backdrop.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy-Focused:</strong> We do not track your personal data. Your sessions are private,
                and your well-being is our priority.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>
            We envision a world where everyone has easy access to tools that support their mental health and
            promote a sense of inner peace. Calm Breathe is just the beginning of our journey to provide
            valuable resources for a calmer, more mindful existence.
        </p>
