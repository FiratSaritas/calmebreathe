        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p><em>Last updated: June 11, 2025</em></p>
        <p>
            At Calm Breathe, your privacy is of utmost importance to us. This Privacy Policy outlines
            how we collect, use, and protect any information you provide while using our website.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
            We are committed to providing a privacy-focused experience. As such, Calm Breathe
            <strong>does not collect any personal identifiable information (PII)</strong> from its users.
            We do not require registration, collect names, email addresses, IP addresses, or any
            other data that could be used to identify you personally.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you use our site, your choices (e.g., selected mood, environment, duration) are processed
            locally within your browser to facilitate the session. This information is not stored on our
            servers or shared with third parties.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Analytics and Usage Data</h3>
        <p>
            We may use anonymous, aggregated usage data (e.g., number of sessions started, most popular
            choices) for internal analytical purposes to understand how the service is used and to improve it.
            This data is entirely anonymous and cannot be linked back to individual users.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Cookies</h3>
        <p>
            Calm Breathe uses minimal cookies, primarily for functional purposes (e.g., to remember your
            last selections locally for a smoother user experience if you revisit). These cookies do not
            contain personal information and are not used for tracking across other websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            Third-party services, such as Google AdSense, may use cookies. Please refer to their
            respective privacy policies for more information:

            Our website uses Google AdSense to display advertisements. Google, as a third-party vendor,

        <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
        <p>
            We implement reasonable security measures to protect the integrity and security of our website.
            However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
            While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee
            its absolute security.
        </p>
